# Esp32 Water level tank measurements

This project is a PlatformIO-based application designed for the ESP32 microcontroller (TTGO T-Display ESP32) and 
ultrasound sensor JSN-SR04T. 
The program measure water distance in water tank with ultrasound sensor and display the results on a TFT display.

## Ultrasound sensor JSN-SR04T

Supported range: 0.25 - 3 m
Precision: up to 0.5 mm
